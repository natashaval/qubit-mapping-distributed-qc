These tables show the benchmark result of various layouts running benchmark algorithms for 5, 10, and 15 circuit size. \\
layout: layout configuration with the first number is the number of qubits and the second one is the number of group \\ benchmark: benchmark algorithms \\ $g$: total number of gates \\ $d$: circuit depth \\ $s_B$: total additional swap gates for ``swap basic'' \\ $s_S$: total additional swap gates for ``swap sabre'' \\ $s_L$: total additional swap gates for ``swap lookahead'' \\ $\Delta s_B$: gate difference between ``swap basic-lookahead'' (\%) \\ $\Delta s_S$: gate difference between ``swap sabre-lookahead'' (\%) \\ $d_B$: circuit depth for ``swap basic'' \\ $d_S$: circuit depth for ``swap sabre'' \\ $d_L$: circuit depth for ``swap lookahead'' \\ $\Delta d_B$: depth difference between ``swap basic-lookahead'' (\%) \\ $\Delta d_S$: depth difference between ``swap sabre-lookahead'' (\%) \\
