% These tables present the benchmark results for various layouts running different algorithms on circuit sizes of 5, 10, and 15 qubits. \\
% layout: layout configuration, where the first number indicates the number of qubits and the second number represents the number of groups. \\ benchmark: benchmark algorithms used for testing \\ $g$: total number of gates \\ $d$: circuit depth \\ $s_B$: total additional swap gates for ``swap basic'' \\ $s_S$: total additional swap gates for ``swap sabre'' \\ $s_L$: total additional swap gates for ``swap lookahead'' \\ $\Delta s_B$: gate difference between ``swap basic-lookahead'' (\%) \\ $\Delta s_S$: gate difference between ``swap sabre-lookahead'' (\%) \\ $d_B$: circuit depth for ``swap basic'' \\ $d_S$: circuit depth for ``swap sabre'' \\ $d_L$: circuit depth for ``swap lookahead'' \\ $\Delta d_B$: depth difference between ``swap basic-lookahead'' (\%) \\ $\Delta d_S$: depth difference between ``swap sabre-lookahead'' (\%) \\
